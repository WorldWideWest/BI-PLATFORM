## General Info

This project is a small BI platform for businesses that don't have any access to any ERP software. Most companies in B&H are so and we want to make decision making easier.

The platform will be web based and will not require any logins or have any restrictions. The only thing that we will create roule for is table structure.
The deployment will be done on Heroku and this repo will be the base for the deployment. Also on this repo will be setuped automated tests using Github Actions.
